# Programming Foundations 2 - Java
This repository contains a collection of my projects and assignments completed during the "Programming Foundations 2" course, part of my second semester in the Information Systems program at Universitas Indonesia.

The focus of the course is on object-oriented programming concepts using Java, covering topics such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Exception Handling
- Basic Data Structures (Arrays)
- Generics & Collections
- File I/O and Streams
- GUI

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for learning Java programming fundamentals.
